# ricebowl-repo
Repository of rices for my WIP tool called Ricebowl, which allows you to easily install other's rices, or publish your own!  
See [this repo](https://github.com/StikyPiston/Ricebowl) for more details!

## Publishing

- This repo (The one you are on now) is where you can publish your own rice!
- To publish, ensure that either
  - A: You are the owner/author of the rice, or
  - B: You have permission of the owner/author of the rice to submit it to the Ricebowl repos.
- Once the criteria have been met, you can now publish!
- To publish, create a PR on this repo, and edit the `repo.json` file.
- In there, following the structure of the other rices in the repo, add:
  - Your rice's name (MAKE SURE THAT NAME DOESN'T APPEAR ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE REPO)
  - A link to a **public** Git repository where the rice is located, that has a properly formatted `bowl.json` file that will work correctly with Ricebowl.
- Once you are sure everything is correct, submit the PR.
- If the pull request is merged, then congrats, your rice is **now in the repos**!
- To gain more attention to this rice in the repos (optional), then you can add something like this into your rice's git repo: 'This rice can be found n *Ricebowl*: `ricebowl-cli install [rice name]`
